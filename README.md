## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help an investor of our surf shop better understand the weather conditions in Hawaii. Given that the weather is an important factor in whether potential shoppers will surf and ultimately shop, it's important for us to analyze the weather. 

In Module 9's challenge, we were tasked with summarizing the weather in two months: June and December. We created a summary statistics table with the count, mean, std, min temp, and max temps in the two months.

## Results
Below are screen shots of the two summary statistics tables for June and December:

### June

### December

At first glance, Hawaii's weather in both June and December looks a lot nicer than Austin's summer heat wave :hot_face: and the recent snowpocalypse :cold_face:! But in all seriousness, we can see here that even though Hawaii is a vacation spot, there's still a risk of cooler temperatures in the winter. 

The key differences between the weather in June and the weather in December are:
* The minimum temperature in December is as low as 56 (vs. 64 in June)!
* The standard deviation for the temperature in December is 3.75 (vs. 3.26 in June), meaning there could be more variability with winter temps.
* There were almost 200 more data points in June's data compared to the Decembe data.

## Summary
After reviewing the results in the section above, it appears that there could be some sort of seasonality with the surfing season in Hawaii. However, we certainly can't definiteively say that customers wouldn't shop or even surf in the winter months.

Additional queries that could help us inform the investor of the surf shop's seasonality include information on the:
* Water temperatures,
* Precipitation, and
* Tourism in June and December.
