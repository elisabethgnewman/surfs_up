## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help an investor of our surf shop better understand the weather conditions in Hawaii. Given that the weather is an important factor in whether potential shoppers will surf and ultimately shop, it's important for us to analyze the weather. 

In Module 9's challenge, we were tasked with summarizing the weather in two months: June and December. We created a summary statistics table with the count, mean, std, min temp, and max temps in the two months.

## Results
Below are screen shots of the two summary statistics tables for June and December:

### June

### December

At first glance, Hawaii's weather in both June and December looks a lot nicer than Austin's summer heat wave and the recent snowpocalypse :cold_face:!
